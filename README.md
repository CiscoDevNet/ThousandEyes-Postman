# Cisco ThousandEyes API (v6) Postman Collection 📋

This is a [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/ciscodevnet/workspace/cisco-devnet-s-public-workspace/documentation/134222-0715abb3-9d2d-4724-9544-69d2dac6feff) and environment variables covering Cisco ThousandEyes v6 APIs.

## Cisco ThousandEyes 🌍
ThousandEyes is the light that illuminates the path an application takes as it traversing infrastructure outside the
four walls of the traditional enterprise network. When you can see and hence understand the path,
you can assure the user experience is as expected, and know what to remediate when it isn’t.
